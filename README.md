# Project5

Project 5 of Roadmap.sh. 

This is mostly AI, though the Flask aspect was something I had to take a lot of time to get to grips with. I wanted the project to look as the description said. I wanted everything on one webpage, and this does exactly that. 

The learning curve was with Flask as an application and there were a few things that I found difficult to understand, conceptually.

The most difficult thing was the declaration of variables. What made this the most difficult was the concept of building up from HTML, then (with Javascript) adding in more variables that were input from the user, and then using those same variables in Python. Eventually (and I really mean eventually) this began to make sense, but it was not very clear at first. 

The inital program that I made consisted of a few web pages that did this conversion. On one page, you would write in the code and then on the next webpage, the answer would be displayed. This worked well enough, but the AJAX of Javascript was actually what I was looking for in my mind. 

I am surprised at the power of Javascript. Although it has always had the ability to do things like this, I would like to become more familiar with the language itself. Perhaps it won't be too long before I do.

Of course, the specificity and accuracy of the javascript in this project was thanks to AI. I could not have done this without help. I do also feel like Project 5 was designed with javascript in mind.
